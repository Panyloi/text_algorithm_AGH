The Project Gutenberg FAQ 2002

by Jim Tinsley



Important: This file is posted to the Project Gutenberg archives
not as a current guide, more as a historical reference. I hope
that future FAQs will be posted, as the project evolves, but
this one is of its time.

If you want the most up-to-date information from PG, please
see the current version of the FAQ, from the Project Gutenberg
site, or, at the time of posting, at:

Acknowledgements

Writing a FAQ for an organization of fanatical proofreaders has
its ups and downs! I'd like to thank all those who corrected
my facts and my typos, and especially the people who pointed out
the lack of clarity in certain answers. The remaining errors and
opacity are all mine.



Preface to the archive edition

Ironically, Project Gutenberg, which preserves the writings of
others, doesn't have much written history itself. There are
scraps of e-mails and guidelines, but many newsletters and other
internal writings before 1996 have gone to the great bit-bucket
in the sky.

The later half of the '90s marked a graceful blooming of Project
Gutenberg's growth. Three related technical factors contributed: the
explosion in home PCs brought standardization, which made it easy
for non-techies to install scanners, which, in response to the new
demand, became plentiful and cheap. And, of course, these years saw
the rise in popularity of the Internet, which has always been PG's
main channel of communication and distribution.

However, while PG's production expanded geometrically, at Moore's
Law rates, there were barriers to participation. Most volunteers had
to find an eligible book, scan or type it, and proof the resulting
text all by themselves. This was and is a fairly significant amount
of work: 40 painstaking hours would be a typical commitment for one
book.

Beyond that, simply learning the mechanics of producing e-texts
could be a serious challenge for newcomers. Nearly all internal
PG communication, except for the Newsletter, was by private e-mail,
and instructions had to be repeated many times to individual new
volunteers, all of whom showed up with great good will, but most of
whom vanished after a week or two.

Michael Hart was unstinting in his editing of incoming texts and
handling questions by e-mail, but any one person has only so many
hours.

The Directors of Production at the time -- Sue Asscher, Dianne Bean,
John Bickers and David Price -- served as contact points for advice
and help, made enormous efforts of production themselves, and tried
to share the scanned texts among new volunteers for proofing. They
made a huge contribution to building community in PG.

Pietro Di Miceli set up a web site for the project in 1996, and with
the popularization of the Web (as opposed to the Internet), this became
a beacon for readers and new volunteers.

All of these people reached out to willing volunteers, drew them in,
helped them, encouraged them. The Project and all of the readers of
the books, now and in the future, owe these people a great debt.
Without them, Project Gutenberg could not have achieved what it has.
But still, for the most part, each volunteer worked alone.


In 1999, I wrote, in response to an offer to volunteer:

    I think I can best answer your offer, and many others like it,
    by giving an extended description of what actually happens in
    the making of PG texts, and why it's often not easy to get
    started.

    There is no agenda, no master list of tasks ready to be given to
    volunteers. This is often the hardest thing to get across to new
    volunteers. I know I waited quite a while after volunteering for
    someone to give me a job to do before I realized it.


    Exactly five steps are normally performed in the publishing of
    an e-text.

    1. Someone, somewhere gets a public-domain copy of a text they
       want to contribute.

    2. That volunteer confirms its PD status by sending TP&V to
       Michael, and getting copyright clearance.

    3. Someone, usually the same volunteer, scans and corrects the
       text, or, if skilled in typing, types the book into an e-text.

    4. Someone, often a different volunteer, second-proofs the
       e-text, removing the smaller errors.

    5. The e-text is sent to Michael for posting.


    There are three barriers which make it difficult for most people
    to contribute:

    1. Getting a PD book.

    2. People without scanners and typing skills have no way of
       turning a book into an e-text.

    3. Even with a scanner, turning a book into an e-text is not
       easy or quick.

    Since, generally, people who have a PD book don't just want to
    send it off to a stranger for scanning, the people who produce
    e-texts have to get over all three of these barriers. This is
    the bottleneck in production. It's relatively easy to get an
    e-text second-proofed; making it in the first place is the
    hardest part. You need to have a book, the means to turn it into
    an e-text and the time and will to do it.

    After that comes second proofing. There are two problems here.
    One is that there may not be enough texts for all the people who
    want to second-proof; the other is that a lot of beginners just
    abandon texts given to them for second-proofing, which holds up
    the process and is discouraging for others. So a lot of
    volunteers do their own second-proofing or send their texts to
    established contacts with a track record of finishing the job,
    rather than making them available to newbies. The Directors of
    Production do serve as contact points, and at any given moment
    may have some texts for proofing, but they can only distribute
    the texts that have already been made.


    With that explanation out of the way, I can better address your
    question of what you can do.


    Second-proofing is an easy way to start, but material isn't just
    waiting for you. If you want to look for some, post your offer
    here and wait a week or so. If no takers by then, e-mail Michael
    and ask if there are any texts available; he may be able to
    refer you to a Director of Production who has something current.
    You may not get an e-text immediately, but you will get one. Of
    course, you can also look here for offers of e-texts ready to
    proof.

    Your other option is to take on a book yourself. In your case,
    you already have a scanner, so you are equipped to become a
    producer. You need to find a PD book.

    Getting PD books means finding and borrowing or buying them. You
    can do this through used bookshops, libraries or book sites on
    the Internet. I mention a few net sites in the FAQ in the link
    below. I get all my books through them, since they make it easy
    for me to find the books I want. Prices range from $5 up to (in
    my case) about $30.

    The best advice I can offer here is: pick a book that you _want_
    to contribute, and a book you'll enjoy working with--you'll be
    living with it up close and personal for quite a while.



In March and April of 1999, Pietro created the PG Volunteers'
WWWBoard and Greg Newby set up the mailing list gutvol-d, and, for
the first time, volunteers who hadn't been introduced to each other
by Michael or the Directors could meet online and communicate
directly. A few FAQs and HOWTOs were written, covering the basics,
the nitty-gritty of producing books. All of this activity made it
much easier for people to get involved, and the Project experienced
a new influx of interested volunteers. Improved OCR software was
also a factor at this time: in response to the commoditization of
scanners, there was rapid improvement in the quality of OCR, and
better OCR made for easier production of e-texts.  More work was
shared out in co-operative proofing experiments.

It was in this new, expansive atmosphere, with ideas flooding in
from enthusiasts newly energized by the project, that Charles Franks
(Charlz) came up with the idea of a web site that would serve to
distribute the work of proofing a book among many volunteers. But
not only did he think of the concept; he went ahead and did it!

In April 2000, Charlz first requested comments on his idea in
a post on the Volunteers' WWWBoard, and by the end of September,
the first e-texts were queueing up on the production line.

On October 9th, Charlz wrote:

    Number of pages proofed by date:

    2nd    6
    3rd    6
    4th   20  <-- Newsletter
    5th   27
    6th   25
    7th   29
    8th   30
    9th   45!! (and the day ain't over yet)

(The "Newsletter" is a reference to the site being mentioned in
the PG Newsletter on October 4th, 2000).

Distributed Proofreaders, or DP, simply kept growing from there, as
Charlz kept scanning and adding more books and features and
proofers, and its simple organic growth produced 600 e-texts in two
years, but when Charlz asked for more help on Slashdot, a popular
technical news site, on November 8th, 2002, the response blew the
roof off! The pages per day figure jumped from 1,000 to about 10,000
for a while, then settled down at its current 4,000. 4,000 pages,
even given that each page is proofed twice, is a lot of pages. 2,000
produced pages per day is about five full books per day. DP has
formed the backbone of PG's production ever since. Whatever the
future of DP's production, its effect on shared knowledge and
resources, and the communication and community it has built, ensures
that Project Gutenberg will never be the same again.


I began writing this FAQ in March 2002, and was essentially finished
around December 2002. It sat around, with a few tweaks here and
there in response to comments, until the start of September 2003.

Today, it is a useful guide to Project Gutenberg norms and practices.
By the time you read it, it may be ancient history ("Hey, Grandad,
did you REALLY scan things from paper? Why didn't you use your
brain implant?" :-) But it is one record of How Things Were in
Project Gutenberg during this time of change.

Project Gutenberg FAQ 2002

I have a question not answered in this FAQ. How do I ask it?

If it's about how to produce a text, the Volunteers' Board at
<https://www.gutenberg.org/vol/wwwboard/> is generally the best
place to ask.
